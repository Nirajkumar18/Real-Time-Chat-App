##REAL-TIME-CHAT-APPLICATION

##Description

This is a basic chat app that allows users to chat with each other if they are in the same room. I have developed this app through Node.JS and Socket.IO on the backend and HTML, CSS and client side JavaScript on the frontend.

##Features

In this app, users need to enter their name and room name to join the chat. This is done through a form. Users can then send messages to other users in the same room as well as share their current location which is achieved through the use of geo-location API.

It also maintains a list of the users in a particular room and prohibits users with the same name to enter the same room.

It also has a feature that does not allow an user to send profane messages.

##Concepts Used

Socket.IO
Events
Promises
Building dynamic web pages
Asynchronous Node.JS
Server side programming through Express.JS
